* A homebuilt Macchina A0 clone to connect the Android to the ECU.
* TunerPro to change parameters in the tune. (https://tunerpro.net)
* MegaLogViewer HD to analyze data logged by Simostools. (https://www.efianalytics.com/MegaLogViewerHD/)
* Google Drive to move data between computer and Android (e.g. edit the tune on the desktop, save it to the Google Drive, install it from the Drive to the car using the Android).
